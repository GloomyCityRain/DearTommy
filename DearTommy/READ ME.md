This is mostly for me (Deers) because I will 100% forget how to compile this shit properly the second I stop doing it. 

1. Run the make_entry code. In here you can add users and generate passwords as such. 
The output should look like this
CREDENTIAL_STORE = {
    # Example entry format:
    # "Deers": {
    #     "salt": "BASE64_SALT_HERE",
    #     "dk": "BASE64_DERIVED_KEY_HERE",
    #     "iterations": 200000
    # }
    # Paste your generated JSON here.
}
Paste that ouput into the CREDENTIAL_STORE dict
You can delete the make_entry now if you want to get rid of any trace of it, or keep it for later. I don't care

2. Now you can compile the DearTommy.py into an exe and you're pretty much good to go from there

3. If you are downloading this, thanks for looking at it. Don't look at my code too hard :)
